HOW TO COMPILE
--------------
To compile, run the command
	
	make <xxx>

where <xxx> is one of the following

	33sh
	33noprompt
	all

To clean up executables, run
	
	make clean


---------
STRUCTURE
---------
I abstracted the main loop into two parts.

In sh.c, I set up an infinite loop that gets input from STDIN and attempts
to execute that input as a command.

In parser.c, we read input from STDIN and attempt to parse it as a command.

In executor.c, we take our parsed command and attempt to execute it. Note
that if we encounter errors while parsing, we skip attempting to execute and 
instead prompt for input again.

BUGS
----
My program passes all tests in the /course/cs0330/pub/shell_1 directory.

I have no known bugs, although sometimes my error messages differ slightly
from those of the demo.
